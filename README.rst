This is a package to estimate spatially-correlated variance components models/varying intercept models. In addition to a general toolkit to conduct Gibbs sampling in Python, the package also provides an interface to PyMC3 and CODA. For a complete overview, consult the walkthrough_.

--------------------
Installation
--------------------

This package works best in Python 3.5, but unittests pass in Python 2.7 as well. 
Only Python 3.5+ is officially supported. 

To install, first install the Anaconda Python Distribution_ from Continuum Analytics_. Installation of the package has been tested in Windows (10, 8, 7) Mac OSX (10.8+) and Linux using Anaconda 4.2.0, with Python version 3.5. 

Once Anaconda is installed, ``spvcm`` can be installed using ``pip``, the Python Package Manager. 

``pip install spvcm``

To install this from source, one can also navigate to the source directory and use:

``pip install ./``

which will install the package from the target source directory. 

-------------------
Usage
-------------------

To use the package, start up a Python interpreter and run:
``import spvcm.api as spvcm``

Then, many differnet variance components model specificaions are available in:

``spvcm.both``
``spvcm.upper``
``spvcm.lower``

For more thorough directions, consult the Jupyter Notebook, ``using the sampler.ipynb``, which is provided in the ``spvcm/examples`` directory.
